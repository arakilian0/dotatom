# Changelog

## 0.2.0 - Installation
* Minor updates to notification messages
* Created a coming soon notification (placeholder for `help` command)
* Re-wrote installation docs (needs to be built locally) I'm not to sure why the project breaks so much when installed from apm, but it works just fine when you build it locally. For now, the project will move forward with this installation process.

## 0.1.0 - First Release
* Activate, Deactivate, Create, and Edit settings.json with Menu commands
* Animate files off of Atom's tree-view using a settings.json file { "ignore": [globs] }
* Menu command Help was created but currently does nothing (just logs to the console)
* Minimal alert messages
